            <h1>Air Jordan 12 'Flu Game'</h1>
            The Air Jordan 12 'Flu Game' was first released back in 1997 and is still one of the most iconic and memorable pairs of Air Jordans 
            to this day. This pair iconic and memorable because Michael Jordan wore this pair during Game of the 1997 NBA Finals, whilst having 
            flu like symptoms with a 103-degree fever that morning. Though he was unwell, he was still able to lead the Chicago Bulls (his team) to victory
            over their opponent that night, the Utah Jazz.
