            <h1>Air Jordan 11 'Concord'</h1>
            The Air Jordan 11 'Concord' has a glistening shade of black, patent leather, going around edges of the shoes, which contrasted with 
            the clean white base. It is said that when Michael Jordan rose up to take a shot, hints of purple was seen.
