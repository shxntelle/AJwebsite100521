            <h1>Air Jordan 11 'Concord'</h1>
            The Air Jordan 11 'Concord' has a glistening shade of black, patent leather, going around edges of the shoes, which contrasted with 
            the clean white base, and it is said that when Michael Jordan rose up to take a shot, hints of purple was seen. It was May of 1995
            in Orlando, when Michael Jordan made the Air Jordan 11 'Concord' public to the world. Its clean and minimilistic design has been a huge 
            impact to basketball sneakers to this day. The desire to have these Air Jordan 11 Concord's still haven't faded since the first ever 
            release in Orlando.
