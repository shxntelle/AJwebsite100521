            <h1>Air Jordan 1 'Banned'</h1>
            The Air Jordan 1 is a mysterious shoe that was originally released in all different sorts of colorways, and many
            of us believe that the black and red colorway of the Air Jordan 1 was banned 31 years ago. <br> <br> It has been said 
            that Michael Jordan was, or would be fines $5,000 per game whenever he wore a particular pair of Nike basketball shoes with 
            a red and black colorway, as evidenced by 2011's "Banned" Air Jordan 1 High. Referring to the "uniformity of uniform rule" set
            by the NBA, "A player must wear shoes that not only match their uniforms, but matched the shoes worn by their teammates." <br> <br>
            At that time, red and black was one of the most rebellious colorway, and first-year NBA commissioner, David Stern, supposedly "threw 
            them out of the game". Legend says that although the red and black colorway was banned, Michael Jordan continued to wear the pair.
