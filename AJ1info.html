            <h1>Air Jordan 1 'Banned'</h1>
            The Air Jordan 1 is a mysterious shoe that was originally released in all different sorts of colorways, and many
            of us believe that the black and red colorway of the Air Jordan 1 was banned 31 years ago. <br> <br> It has been said 
            that Michael Jordan was, or would be fines $5,000 per game whenever he wore a particular pair of Nike basketball shoes with 
            a red and black colorway, as evidenced by 2011's "Banned" Air Jordan 1 High. Referring to the "uniformity of uniform rule" set
            by the NBA, "A player must wear shoes that not only match their uniforms, but matched the shoes worn by their teammates." and the pair of shoes must
            also contain 51% white. <br> <br>
            Although today, the colorway of basketball sneakers allow any color, but in 1984, red and black was one of the most rebellious colorway in the NBA, and first-year NBA commissioner,
            David Stern, supposedly "threw them out of the game". Legend says that although the red and black colorway was banned, Michael Jordan continued to wear the Air Jordan 1 'Banned'/'Bred'.
