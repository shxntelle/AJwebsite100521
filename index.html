                The first Air Jordan was the Air Jordan 1 'Banned', which were produced exclusively for Michael Jordan in late 1984, but was later realeased for the public on April 1 1985. <br> It is said that because the colors of the sneakers broke the league's uniform rules, the NBA fined Michael Jordan $5,000 everytime he wore the 
                Air Jordan 1 'Banned' during their debut in 1984.

                  Air Jordan 12 'Flu Game' is one of the most iconic pairs of Air Jordans, considering Michael Jordan wore this pair during Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals while having flu-like symptoms. Although, dispite the conditions he was in, he was still able to lead the Chicago Bulls to victory over the Utah Jazz. This pair of shoes
                  remain as one of the most memorable Air Jordan 12's to date. <br>The first pair of Air Jordan 12 'Flu Game' was originally released back in 1997, then later on "retro'd" 2003, shortly after followed by another release in 2009, and the latest remastered version was released on May 28, 2016.
