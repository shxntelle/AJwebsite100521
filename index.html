            <p> 
                The first Air Jordan was the Air Jordan 1 'Banned' (also known as Air Jordan 'Bred' because of the colorways of the shoes), this pair was produced exclusively for Michael Jordan in late 1984, but was later realeased for the public on April 1 1985. 
                <br> It is said that because the colors of the sneakers broke the league's uniform rules, the NBA fined Michael Jordan $5,000 everytime he wore the Air Jordan 1 'Banned' during their debut in 1984.

                  It was May of 1995, when Michael Jordan gave the public its first look at the Air Jordan 11 'Concord'. It was patent leather, with a glistening shade of black
                  which was contrasted against a clean white base, and when Michael Jordan jumped to take his shot, hints of purple peeked out from the shoes. <br> The clean, understate, flowing
                  design of the shoes impacted basketball sneakers for many years. The desire to have this pair hasn't faded since that May of 1995. To this day, MJ is still obsessed with how the Air Jordan 11's 
                  performs on court, the patent leather on the shoes was first and foremost an idea that helped keep his feet stay locked on hard stops and cuts during his game.

                  Air Jordan 12 'Flu Game' is one of the most iconic pairs of Air Jordans, considering Michael Jordan wore this pair during Game 5 of the 1997 NBA Finals while having flu-like symptoms. Although, dispite the conditions he was in, he was still able to lead the Chicago Bulls to victory over the Utah Jazz. This pair of shoes
                  remain as one of the most memorable Air Jordan 12's to date. <br>The first pair of Air Jordan 12 'Flu Game' was originally released back in 1997, then later on "retro'd" 2003, shortly after followed by another release in 2009, and the latest remastered version was released on May 28, 2016.
